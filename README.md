# Real time facial and emotion detection and classification application

To run this program yourself you will need to download the dataset from Kaggle

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset

Once the dataset is downloaded and important into your workbook, you may adapt the paths in order to connect the dataset and the model. I recommend using a GPU accelerated Kaggle environment in order to get the best results. 
WHen the files are uploaded, follow the instructions in the PDF and in the code comments in order to get a .h5 model which will contain all of the weights and parameters for the program to run directly.
With the model trained and set up, you may either use it in a Google colabs environment or use it on a web application, the underlying proceedure will be consistent across different deployment methods.
